# Professional Data Engineer

> A Professional Data Engineer enables data-driven decision making by

    collecting, transforming, and publishing data. 
    
> A data engineer should be able to 

    design, build, operationalize, secure, and monitor data processing systems with a particular emphasis on 
    
    - security and compliance; 
    - scalability and efficiency; 
    - reliability and fidelity; 
    - flexibility and portability. 
    
A data engineer should also be able to 

    leverage, deploy, and continuously train pre-existing machine learning models.

And that concludes in below four parts:

1. Designing data processing systems

    - Selecting the appropriate storage technologies
    - Designing data pipelines
    - Designing a data processing solution
    - Migrating data warehousing and data processing

2. Building and operationalizing data processing systems

    - Building and operationalizing storage systems
    - Building and operationalizing pipelines
    - Building and operationalizing processing infrastructure

3. Operationalizing machine learning models

    - Deploying an ML pipeline
    - Leveraging pre-built ML models as a service
    - Choosing the appropriate training and serving infrastructure
    - Measuring, monitoring, and troubleshooting machine learning models

4. Ensuring solution quality

    - Designing for security and compliance
    - Ensuring scalability and efficiency
    - Ensuring reliability and fidelity
    - Ensuring flexibility and portability
